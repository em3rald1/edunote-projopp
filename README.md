# Edunote

Edunote is a tool for keeping your notes safe and in order. It is also an easy way to share your notes to others students. <br />


It works by storing your notes either on your local disc or on the FTP of the public edunote server. <br />
You can upload, remove and edit notes on the public server if the note's creator is yourself or has given you the permission to do such actions with the note.
